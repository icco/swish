= Swish! A Ruby wrapper for the Dribbble API

Learn about the Dribbble API at http://dribbble.com/api.

== Installation

Swish is just a Ruby gem:

  gem install swish

* ExpressionEngine 2: http://olivierbon.com/projects/dreebbble

== Examples

  require 'swish'
  
  # Find a shot
  shot = Dribbble::Shot.find(21603)
  
  # See some data about the shot
  shot.title
  shot.image_url
  shot.url
  shot.player.name
  shot.views_count
  shot.likes_count
  shot.comments_count
  shot.rebounds_count

  # Or get a shot's rebounds
  shot.rebounds
  
  # Find more shots
  inspiring       = Dribbble::Shot.popular
  call_the_police = Dribbble::Shot.everyone
  yay_noobs       = Dribbble::Shot.debuts
  
  # Find a player
  player = Dribbble::Player.find('jeremy')
  
  # See some data about the player
  player.name
  player.avatar_url
  player.url
  player.location
  player.twitter_screen_name
  player.drafted_by_player_id
  
  # Player stats
  player.shots_count
  player.draftees_count
  player.followers_count
  player.following_count

  # List a player's shots
  player.shots

  # List shots by players that this player follows
  player.shots_following

  # List a player's draftees
  player.draftees

  # List a player's followers
  player.followers

  # List the players who a player is following
  player.following

== Pagination

The Dribbble API returns paginated lists, with a default page size of 15 items. Swish makes it easy to traverse the pages of any list.

  # Get the second page of popular shots, with 30 shots per page
  shots = Dribbble::Shot.popular(:page => 2, :per_page => 30)
  
  # Some useful stats for rendering pagination links
  shots.page     # => current page number
  shots.per_page # => number of items per page
  shots.total    # => total number of items on all pages
  shots.pages    # => total number of pages
  
  # Try it with other lists
  Dribbble::Player.find('jeremy').shots(:per_page => 5)
  Dribbble::Player.find('jeremy').shots_following(:page => 10)
  Dribbble::Shot.find(21603).rebounds(:page => 2, :per_page => 10)

See http://dribbble.com/api#pagination for more information.

Email jeremy@weiskotten.com if you should be on this list. Apologies and thanks in advance.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
